We are a small team who prioritise satisfaction and excellence in our work, and we will do our utmost to ensure that you are content in your role, accommodating for your needs. We aim to foster an honest and democratic culture, where all voices are equally important, and everyone is treated with respect.\\n\\n**The Skills:**\\n\\n\\nYou must be hungry to learn and eager to expand your technical abilities, focusing on the modelling of chemical data. You\\u2019ll need a keen nose for where data science can be harnessed to drive productivity, both in the small and large scales, and where new sources of information can be harnessed. To these ends, you will require a solid background in organic chemistry, with significant experience in data science using Python, and an excellent understanding of the state of machine learning and deep learning as applied to the chemical sciences.\\n\\n**The Future:**\\n\\n\\nWorking at Sika bestows you with the opportunity to progress within a global company across a variety of business areas. You\\u2019ll learn about different sectors of the business, getting the chance to build networks with various departments across the world.
